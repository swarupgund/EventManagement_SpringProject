# Eventify - Event Management System

**Eventify** is a full-stack event management system built using React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. This project allows users to register, book events, and manage their participation, while admins can create, manage, and track events seamlessly.

## Introduction
Eventify provides a platform for managing events efficiently. Users can view and book events, while admins can manage events and participant data. The application is secure, user-friendly, and responsive for both desktop and mobile use.

## Features
- User Registration and Login
- Event Creation and Management (Admin)
- Event Booking (User)
- Payment Integration
- Dashboard for both Users and Admins
- Email Notifications
- Event Search and Filtering
- Responsive Design
- Reports and Analytics
- Role-based Access Control (Admin/User)
- Security with Spring Security
- Feedback System

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: thymeleaf
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Build Tools**: Maven
- **Other**: VS Code, Spring Tool Suite (STS)

## Project Setup

### Backend Setup
1. Ensure **Java JDK 11+** and **Maven** are installed.
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd eventify-backend
   ```
3. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and configure the database connection:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/eventify_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```
4. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
5. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Database Setup
1. Install **MySQL** and create a database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE eventify_db;
   ```
2. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and adjust the database properties as needed.

3. Use **JPA** to automatically generate the necessary tables. On running the backend for the first time, tables for users, events, bookings, and feedback will be created automatically.

## Running the Application
Once both the frontend and backend are running:
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`

1. Navigate to the frontend in your browser.
2. Register as a user or log in as an admin (admin credentials need to be set up in the database manually).
3. Explore features such as creating events (admin) or booking events (user).
4. Admin --  User Name And Password Avaliable in RegisterController*

## Code Walkthrough

### Backend
- **src/main/java/com/eventify**: Main package for the Spring Boot application.
  - **controller**: Contains REST controllers for handling API requests.
  - **service**: Contains business logic for event and user management.
  - **repository**: Handles data persistence using Spring Data JPA.
  - **model**: Defines the entities (Event, User, Booking, etc.).
  - **security**: Configures Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.

### Database
- **schema.sql**: Optional SQL file to set up the database schema if automatic schema generation is not enabled.
- **data.sql**: Optional SQL file to populate the database with initial data.

Enjoy managing events with Eventify!
